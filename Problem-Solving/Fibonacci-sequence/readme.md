# Fibonacci sequence

Write a function  ´´´fib(n)´´´ that takes in a number as an argument.
The function should return the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

The 1st and 2nd number of the sequence is 1.
To generate the next number of the sequence, we sum the previous two.

```
  n:      1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ,8 ,9 ...
  fib(n): 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34...
```
